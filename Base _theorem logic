Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) ( 1 )

Images: 517
Causative Agent: Bacteria
Affected Plant Parts & Life Stages:
Infects rice at both the seedling and mature stages
Primarily targets the leaves
Conditions in Sri Lanka:

Occurs in both irrigated and rainfed lowland areas
(Reference: Department of Agriculture Sri Lanka)
Back-End Implementation (Python FastAPI):

Data Collection:
ESP32 sends sensor data: Temperature, Humidity, Nitrogen Level, Rice Variety
Processing Function: BLB_pre_diseases()
Farmer Input:
Query with three questions:
A: Is there an irrigation area near you?
B: Is there any rainfed lowland?
C: Is there any rainfed upland?
Probability Calculations:

Irrigation/Field Type:

If A (only true): P(BLB/Irrigated) = 0.575
If B (only true): P(BLB/Lowland) = 0.300
If C (only true): P(BLB/Upland) = 0.175
If (A, B) are true: P = 0.575
If (A, C) are true: P = 0.575
With priors:
P(A) = 0.65
P(B) = 0.25
P(C) = 0.10
Intersection:
P(A∩C) = 0.065
P(A∩B) = 0.150
Temperature Conditions:

< 20°C:
P(BLB/<20°C) = 0.1; P(<20°C) = 0.075
20–24°C:
P(BLB/20–24°C) = 0.3; P(20–24°C) = 0.175
25–34°C:
P(BLB/25–34°C) = 0.7; P(25–34°C) = 0.650
> 34°C:
P(BLB/>34°C) = 0.4; P(>34°C) = 0.125
Rice Variety (from Deepseek-R1):

P(BLB | Naadu Samba) = 0.70
P(BLB | Kiri Samba) = 0.60
P(BLB | Ponni Samba) = 0.50
P(BLB | Samba (sudu)) = 0.60
P(BLB | Samba (rathu)) = 0.70
P(BLB | Samba (kalu)) = 0.80
P(BLB | Kalu Heenati) = 0.80
P(BLB | Rathu Heenati) = 0.70
P(BLB | Suwandel) = 0.70
P(BLB | Mahayaraththa) = 0.80
P(BLB | IR64) = 0.40
P(BLB | BG 352) = 0.40
P(BLB | BG 358) = 0.30
Also, assume a uniform prior: P(Variety) = 1/13 ≈ 0.076
Nitrogen Fertilizer Application:

< 80 kg/ha:
P(BLB / <80) = 0.15; P(<80) = 0.15
80–120 kg/ha:
P(BLB / 80–120) = 0.30; P(80–120) = 0.60
> 120 kg/ha:
P(BLB / >120) = 0.70; P(>120) = 0.25
Humidity Conditions:

< 70% RH:
P(BLB / <70) = 0.15
70–80% RH:
P(BLB / 70–80) = 0.40
> 80% RH:
P(BLB / >80) = 0.80
Additional humidity condition probabilities:
Condition 1: 0.125
Condition 2: 0.350
Condition 3: 0.550
